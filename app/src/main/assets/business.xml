We just held our tenth and final week of the Hacking for Defense class. Today the eight teams presented their Lessons Learned presentations. We’re a little stunned about how well the first prototype of this class went. Over half the student teams have decided to continue working on national security projects after this class. Other colleges and universities have raised their hand and said they want to offer this at their school.[&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=steveblank.com&#038;blog=6599589&#038;post=21384&#038;subd=steveblank&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

Innovation outposts in Silicon Valley allow big companies to sense and respond to rapid changes in technology. Big data is changing how we view the world, and is the fuel for machine intelligence. How to make corporate innovation work and drive success in startups were the topics of discussion with the guests on today’s Entrepreneurs are Everywhere radio show.
The show follows the journeys of founders who share what it takes to build a startup – from restaurants to rocket scientists, to online gifts to online groceries and more. The program examines the DNA of entrepreneurs: what makes them tick, how they came up with their ideas; and explores the habits that make them successful, and the highs and lows that pushed them forward.[&#8230;]<img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=steveblank.com&#038;blog=6599589&#038;post=21302&#038;subd=steveblank&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />

His previous startup was Frewg, a regional online textbook rental service.</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>While building EduSourced, David learned some lessons around getting funded:</strong></p> <p><strong><em>David</em></strong><em>: We weren&#8217;t ready to scale when we first took investors money, which tells me that we took the money too early, but I didn&#8217;t know that at the time. </em></p> <p><em>Taking money from investors meant that there was pressure to scale, and pressure to hire, and that hire included a high-powered sales executive, but we did this without understanding our own value proposition.</em></p> <p><strong><em>Steve</em></strong><em>: You mean that&#8217;s who your investors were telling you to hire? Go hire a sales exec to scale?</em></p> <p><strong><em>David</em></strong><em>: Yeah. I can understand from the outside looking in, that would seem to make sense, bring somebody in who&#8217;s done that before, but we didn&#8217;t understand our value proposition.
